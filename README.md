# FPGA Architecture and CAD

This course introduces the characteristics, evolution and usage of field-programmable technologies, and also look into some advanced researches related to FPGA architecture and CAD. 
On the hardware side, we investigate the tradeoff involved in finding a balanced FPGA architecture and study some recent commercial FPGA architectures as examples. 
On the software side, we look at the FPGA design flow and study the design of efficient FPGA CAD tools for technology mapping, placement, and routing, etc. to optimize power and performance.
New directions of architecture & CAD research is also explored.
