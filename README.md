# FPGA-Architecture-and-CAD

This course first introduces the characteristics, evolution and usage of field-programmable technologies, and then continues to look into some advanced researches related to FPGA architecture and CAD. 
On the hardware side, we will investigate the tradeoff involved in finding a balanced FPGA architecture and study some recent commercial FPGA architectures as examples. 
On the software side, we will look at the FPGA design flow and study the design of efficient FPGA CAD tools for technology mapping, placement, and routing, etc. to optimize power and performance. New directions of architecture & CAD research will be explored together at the end.
